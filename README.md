# 🏭 Aluminum Extrusion Factory Simulation using Arena

This project presents a comprehensive simulation and analysis of an **aluminum extrusion manufacturing system** using **Arena Simulation Software**. The goal was to replicate a real-world extrusion factory, evaluate its operational performance, and implement improvements that increase productivity and reduce defects.

## 📌 Project Objective

To simulate and optimize the aluminum extrusion production process by:
- Mapping each stage of the factory workflow (from billet loading to final coating)
- Identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and quality issues
- Proposing and validating improvements using Arena simulation
- Quantifying the performance improvements in throughput and defect reduction

## 🏗️ Factory Process Overview

The simulated system includes the following major stages:
1. **Billet Loading**
2. **Heating**
3. **Extrusion through dies**
4. **Cooling**
5. **Aging Oven**
6. **Powder Coating**
7. **Final Quality Check**

These stages represent real-world operations commonly found in aluminum manufacturing facilities, particularly those that serve construction and automotive sectors.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The following structured approach was applied:

### 🔍 1. Research & Data Collection
- Conducted on-site factory visits and expert interviews
- Reviewed production line documentation
- Collected data on process times, quality rates, and material flow

### 📊 2. Simulation Modeling
- Built the process in **Arena Simulation Software**
- Calibrated model parameters using real factory data
- Ran baseline simulation to benchmark current performance

### 📈 3. Analysis & Optimization
- Identified bottlenecks (e.g., long crane transfer times and oven delays)
- Measured yield, throughput, and quality defect rates
- Applied Lean principles such as 5S and layout redesign

## 🚀 Key Results

### Before Improvements:
- Average **defect rate**: 23%  
- **Crane transfer** time per billet: 45 minutes  
- **Aging oven** delay: 210 minutes

### After Improvements:
- **Defect rate reduced** to **16%**
- **Production efficiency improved by 13%**
- Enhanced **material flow** with redesigned layout
- Quality control introduced early in the process (Quality at Source)

## 🔧 Improvements Implemented

- **Redesigned Plant Layout**: Separated entry/exit for raw and finished goods
- **Integrated Early Quality Control**: Reduced rework and scrap
- **Applied 5S**: Cleaner workspaces improved safety and defect tracking

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

- Difficulty accessing accurate factory data
- Model calibration required iterative testing and validation
- Identifying hidden bottlenecks required deep process observation

## ✅ Project Outcome

This simulation project proved how digital tools like **Arena** can support **data-driven process optimization**. The analysis not only revealed hidden inefficiencies but also offered **practical improvements** that could be implemented in a real production setting.

The project demonstrates valuable skills in:
- **Process analysis and simulation**
- **Industrial engineering and lean methodology**
- **Data-driven decision making in manufacturing**
